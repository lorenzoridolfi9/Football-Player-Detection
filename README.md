## This repository contains project files of Computer Vision. In particular, Yolov8 have been applied for object detection tasks, which can create model that recognize football players and others in the frame.

# Dataset üìä 

### Soccer Players Detection Image is the name of the dataset used in the following project, containing frames of soccer games. it is divided into three parts:
- __Train-set(80%)__: 531 training frames of the model
- __Validation-set(10%)__: 66 frames of model validation
- __Test-set(10%)__: 66 frames for testing the model

The dataset was taken from Roboflow, which also annotated the classes for each frame. You can see the Roboflow universe from [this link](https://universe.roboflow.com/).
